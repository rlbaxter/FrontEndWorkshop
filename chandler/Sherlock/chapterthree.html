I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
into the room.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Not yet."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"But you have hopes?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I have hopes."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"We must have a cab."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"No, my brougham is waiting."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
once more for Briony Lodge.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Married! When?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Yesterday."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"But to whom?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"To an English lawyer named Norton."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"But she could not love him."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I am in hopes that she does."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"And why in hopes?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
Serpentine Avenue.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
from the brougham.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
Cross for the Continent."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Never to return."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
them, and came down just as you departed.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
started for the Temple to see my husband.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s" class="signature">	
                                      "Very truly yours,
                                      </p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s" class="signature">	
                                   "IRENE NORTON, n√©e ADLER."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
to a more successful conclusion."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
highly," said Holmes.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"You have but to name it."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"This photograph!"
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
The King stared at him in amazement.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
chambers.
</p>
<p class="fadeIn fadeIn-3s fadeIn-Delay-3s">	
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
