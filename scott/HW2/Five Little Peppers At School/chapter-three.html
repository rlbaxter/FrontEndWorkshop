<p>
Joel, in such an emergency, wiped his black eyes and looked up sharply.
David sank on the upper step.

</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Tom," cried Joel, crowding in between Beresford and the door,
"it can't be. Get out of the way; let me try."
</p>

<p>
"It is--it is, I tell you," howled Tom in what was more of a whine, as
he kept one eye out for John and his lantern. "The mean sneak has got
the best of us, Joe." He set his teeth hard together, and his face
turned white.
</p>

<p>
Joe dropped the doorknob, and whirled off the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Julius CÃ¦sar! where are you going?" began Tom, as Joel disappeared
around the corner of the dormitory.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone to see if John is coming, I suppose," said Davie weakly.
</p>

<p>
Tom, preferring to see for himself, skipped off, and disappeared around
the angle. "Oh--oh!" was what David heard next, making him fly from his
step to follow in haste.
</p>

<p>
What he saw was so much worse than all his fears as Tom gripped his arm
pointing up over his head, that he screamed right out, "Oh Joe, come
back, you'll be killed!"
</p>

<p>
"He can't come back," said Tom hoarsely. "He'd much better go on." Joel,
more than halfway up the lightning conductor, was making good time
shinning along. He turned to say, "I'm all right, Dave," as a window
above them was thrown up, and a head in a white nightcap was thrust out.
</p>

<p>
"It's all up with him now; there's old Fox," groaned Tom, ducking softly
back over the grass. "Come on, Dave."
</p>

<p>
But David, with clasped hands and white face, had no thought of
deserting Joel.
</p>

<p>
The person in the window, having the good sense to utter no exclamation,
waited till Joel was up far enough for her to grasp his arm. Then she
couldn't help it as she saw his face.
</p>

<p>
"_Joel Pepper!_"
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm," said Joel, turning his chubby face toward her. "I knew I could
get up here; it's just as easy as anything."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fox set her other hand to the task of helping him into the dimly
lighted hall, much to Joel's disgust, as he would much have preferred to
enter unassisted. Then she turned her cap-frills full on him, and said
in a tone of great displeasure, "What _is_ the meaning of all this?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I had to go out, Mrs. Fox."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh--I--I--had to."
</p>

<p>
She didn't ask him again, for the matron was a woman of action, and in
all her dealings with boys had certain methods by which she brought them
to time. So she only set her sharp eyes, that Dr. Marks' pupils always
called "gimlets," full upon him. "Go to your room," was all she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mrs. Fox," cried Joel, trying dreadfully to control himself, and
twisting his brown hands in the effort, "I--I--had to go. Really I did."
</p>

<p>
"So you said before. _Go to your room._" Then a second thought struck
her. "Was any other boy with you?" she demanded suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Joel gave a sharp cry of distress as he started down the hall, revolving
in his mind how he would steal down and unlock the door as soon as the
matron had taken herself off.
</p>

<p>
"Here, stop--come back here! Now answer me--yes or no--was any other boy
with you?" as Joel stood before her again.
</p>

<p>
Joel's stubby black curls dropped so that she couldn't see his face. As
there was no reply forthcoming, Mrs. Fox took him by the arm. "You
needn't go to your room, Joel," she said sharply. "You may go to
Coventry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mrs. Fox," Joel burst out, "don't--don't send me there."
</p>

<p>
"A boy who cannot answer me, is fit only for Coventry," said Mrs. Fox
with great dignity, despite the nightcap. "Wait here, Joel. I will get
my candle, and light you down." She stepped off to a corner of the hall,
where she had set the candlestick on a table, when startled by the noise
outside. "Now we will go."
</p>

<p>
It was impossible that all this confusion should not awake some of the
boys in the hall; and by this time there was much turning on pillows,
and leaning on elbows, and many scuttlings out of bed to listen at doors
opened a crack, so that nearly every one of the occupants, on that
particular hall soon knew that "old Fox" had Joel Pepper in her
clutches, and that he was being led off somewhere.
</p>

<p>
And at last Joel let it out himself. "Oh Mrs. Fox--dear Mrs. Fox,
_don't_ make me go to Coventry," he roared. He clutched her wrapper, a
big, flowered affair that she wore on such nocturnal rambles, and held
it fast. "I'll be just as good," he implored.
</p>

<p>
"Coventry is the place for you, Joel Pepper," said Mrs. Fox grimly; "so
we will start."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile David, holding his breath till he saw, in the dim light that
always streamed out from the dormitory hall where the gas was left
turned down at night, that Joel was safely drawn in to shelter,
frantically rushed around to the big door, in the wild hope that somehow
admittance would be gained. "Joe will come by and by," he said to
himself, sinking down on the steps.
</p>

<p>
"We're done for," said Tom's voice off in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Tom, are you there?" cried Davie, straining his eyes to catch a
glimpse.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" Tom poked his head out from a clump of shrubbery. "Don't you
dare to breathe. I tell you, Dave, our only hope is in staying here till
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear me!" exclaimed David in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear me!" echoed Tom in derision. It was impossible for him to stop
talking, he was so keyed up. "It's paradise, I'm sure, compared to being
in old Fox's grip."
</p>

<p>
This brought David back to Joel's plight, and he sighed dismally, and
leant his head on his hands. How long he sat there he couldn't have
told. The first thing he did know, a big hand was laid on his shoulder,
and a bright glare of light fell full on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh my soul and body!" cried John, the watchman, bending over him, "if
here ain't one of th' boys dead asleep on the doorsteps!"
</p>

<p>
"Little goose, to sit there!" groaned Tom, huddling back into his
bushes. "Now it's all up with him. Well, I'll save my skin, for I don't
believe those boys will tell on me."
</p>

<p>
"Coventry" was a small square room in the extension, containing a bed, a
table, and a chair, where the boys who were refractory were sent. It was
considered a great disgrace to be its inmate. They were not locked in;
but no boy once put there was ever known to come out unless bidden by
the authorities. And no one, of course, could speak to them when they
emerged from it to go to recitations, for their lessons must be learned
in the silence of this room. Then back from the class-room the culprit
must go to this hated place, to stay as long as his misdemeanor might
seem to deserve.
</p>

<p>
It was so much worse punishment than a flogging could possibly be, that
all Dr. Marks' boys heard "Coventry" with a chill that stopped many a
prank in mid-air.
</p>

<p>
But Joel didn't get into "Coventry" after all, for at the foot of the
stairs, another candle-beam was advancing; and back of it was the thin,
sharp face of Mr. Harrow, one of the under-teachers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mr. Harrow," screamed Joel, breaking away from the matron, to plunge
up to him, "she's going to put me into Coventry. Oh, don't make me go
there; it will kill my Mamsie, and Polly."
</p>

<p>
"Hey?" Mr. Harrow came to a sudden stop, and whirled the candlestick
around to get a better view of things. "What's this, Mrs. Fox? And _Joel
Pepper_, of all boys!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it," said Mrs. Fox, her candlestick shaking in an unsteady hand.
"Well, you see, sir, I was going upstairs to see if little Fosdick had
blankets enough; it's turned cold, and you know he's had a sore throat,
and----"
</p>

<p>
"Well, come to the point, Mrs. Fox," said the teacher, bringing her up
quickly. Joel clung desperately to his hand, shaking violently in every
limb.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sir--well, and I heard a noise outside, so I bethought me to
look, and there was this boy climbing up the lightning conductor."
</p>

<p>
"Up the lightning conductor?" echoed Mr. Harrow.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir,"--Mrs. Fox's cap-frills trembled violently as she
nodded,--"Joel Pepper was climbing up the lightning conductor, sir. And
I thought I should have dropped to see him, sir."
</p>

<p>
The under-teacher turned and surveyed Joel. "Well, I think, Mrs. Fox,"
he said slowly, "if he's been over that lightning conductor to-night, we
won't put him in Coventry."
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't answer when I asked him if any other boys were there," said
the matron, a dull red spot coming on either cheek.
</p>

<p>
"That's bad--very bad," said Mr. Harrow. "Well, I'll take Joel under my
care. Do you go to bed, Mrs. Fox."
</p>

<p>
It was all done in a minute. Somehow Mrs. Fox never quite realized how
she was left standing alone. And as there really wasn't anything else
for her to do, she concluded to take the under-teacher's advice.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Joel,"--Mr. Harrow looked down at his charge,--"you seem to be
left for me to take care of. Well, suppose you come into my room, and
tell me something about this affair."
</p>

<p>
Joel, with his heart full of distress about David and Tom, now that the
immediate cause of alarm over his being put into "Coventry" was gone,
could scarcely conceal his dismay, as he followed Mr. Harrow to his
room. He soon found himself on a chair; and the under-teacher, setting
his candlestick down, took an opposite one.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind telling me all about this little affair of yours, Joe?"
said Mr. Harrow, leading off easily. His manner, once away from the
presence of the matron, was as different as possible; and Joel, who had
never met him in just this way, stared in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Joe," the under-teacher went on, and he began to play with
some pencils on the table, "it isn't so very long ago, it seems to me,
since I was a boy. And I climbed lightning conductors too. I really did,
Joel."
</p>

<p>
Joel's black eyes gathered a bright gleam in their midst.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and at night, too," said the under-teacher softly, "though I
shouldn't want you to mention it to the boys. So now, if you wouldn't
mind, Joel, I should really like to hear all about this business of
yours."
</p>

<p>
But Joel twisted his hands, only able to say, "Oh dear! I can't tell,
Mr. Harrow." His distress was dreadful to see.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the under-teacher slowly, "perhaps in the morning you'll
feel better able to tell. I won't press it now. You must get to bed,
Joe," with a keen look at his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mr. Harrow--would you--would you--" Joel jumped out of his seat, and
over to the under-teacher's chair.
</p>

<p>
"Would I what?" asked Mr. Harrow in perplexity, wishing very much that
"Mamsie," whom he had seen on her visits to the school, were there at
that identical moment.
</p>

<p>
"Would you--oh, might I unlock the--the back door?" gasped Joel, his
black eyes very big with distress.
</p>

<p>
"Unlock the back door?" repeated Mr. Harrow. Then he paused a moment.
"Certainly; I'll go with you." He got out of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sir," cried Joel tumbling back, "I'll--I'll do it alone if I
may; please, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Joel, that can't ever be allowed," Mr. Harrow was saying
decidedly, when steps were heard coming down the hall, and there was
John, the watchman, hauling David Pepper along the dimly lighted hall to
the extra gleam of the under-teacher's room.
</p>

<p>
"I found this boy asleep on the steps," announced John, coming in with
his charge.
</p>

<p>
"Why, David Pepper!" exclaimed Mr. Harrow in astonishment. Then he
turned a cold glance on Joel, who flew over to Davie's side.
</p>

<p>
"Joel!" cried David convulsively, and blinking dreadfully as he came
into the light. "Oh, I'm so glad you're safe--oh, so glad, Joey!" He hid
his face on Joel's arm, and sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"You may go, John," said the under-teacher to that individual, who kept
saying, "I found that boy asleep on the steps," over and over, unable to
stop himself. "And don't say anything about this to any one. I will take
care of the matter."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir," said John, glad to be relieved of all responsibility,
and touching his cap. "I found that boy asleep on the steps," he added
as he took himself off.
</p>

<p>
"Now, see here." Mr. Harrow laid his hand on David's shoulder, ignoring
Joel for the time, and drew him aside. "The whole of this business must
be laid before me, David. So begin."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Dave!" cried Joel, springing up to him. "Oh, sir--oh, Mr. Harrow, it
was all my fault, truly it was. David only came after me. Oh Mr. Harrow,
don't make him tell."
</p>

<p>
"You go and sit down in that chair, Joel," said Mr. Harrow, pointing to
it. So Joel went, and got on it, twisting miserably.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, David."
</p>

<p>
"You see," said David, the tears still rolling down his cheeks,
"that--oh dear!--Joel was gone, and--"
</p>

<p>
"How did you know Joel was gone?" interrupted the under-teacher.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" David caught his breath. "Another boy told me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
David hesitated. "Must I tell, sir?" not trusting himself to look at
Joel.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Tom Beresford."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" Joel sprang from his chair. "He hadn't anything to do with it,
sir. Tom has been awfully good. He only told Dave."
</p>

<p>
"Go back to your chair, Joel," said Mr. Harrow. "Now, then, David, go
on. So you went out with Beresford to find Joel, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said David faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Any other boy?" asked the under-teacher quickly.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Tom is waiting out there, I suppose, now." Mr. Harrow got
out of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"He didn't have anything to do with it, sir," cried Joel wildly, and
flying out of his chair again, "truly he didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I understand." Mr. Harrow nodded. "I'm going to bring him in. Now it
isn't necessary to tell you two boys not to do any talking while I'm
gone." With that he went over to a corner, took down a lantern, lighted
it, and passed out.
</p>

<p>
When he came back, both Joel and David knew quite well by Tom's face,
that the whole story was out; and Joel, who understood as well as any
one that Floyd Jenkins never by any possibility could be a favorite
with instructors, any more than with the boys, unless he changed his
whole tactics, groaned again at thought that he had made matters worse
for him.
</p>

<p>
"Now all three of you scatter to bed," was all the under-teacher said as
he came in with Tom. "No talking now; get up as softly as you can. Good
night."
