<p>The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving
memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is
long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one
Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long
past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the
beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning
of the Wheel of Time. But it was <em>a</em> beginning.</p>

<p>Born below the ever cloud-capped peaks that gave the mountains
their name, the wind blew east, out across the Sand Hills, once the
shore of a great ocean, before the Breaking of the World. Down it
flailed into the Two Rivers, into the tangled forest called the
Westwood, and beat at two men walking with a cart and horse down
the rock-strewn track called the Quarry Road. For all that spring
should have come a good month since, the wind carried an icy chill
as if it would rather bear snow.</p>

<p>Gusts plastered Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s cloak to his back, whipped the
earth-colored wool around his legs, then streamed it out behind
him. He wished his coat were heavier, or that he had worn an extra
shirt. Half the time when he tried to tug the cloak back around him
it caught on the quiver swinging at his hip. Trying to hold the
cloak one-handed did not do much good anyway; he had his bow in the
other, an arrow nocked and ready to draw.</p>

<p>As a particularly strong blast tugged the cloak out of his hand,
he glanced at his father over the back of the shaggy brown mare. He
felt a little foolish about wanting to reassure himself that Tam
was still there, but it was that kind of day. The wind howled when
it rose, but aside from that, quiet lay heavy on the land. The soft
creak of the axle sounded loud by comparison. No birds sang in the
forest, no squirrels chittered from a branch. Not that he expected
them, really; not this spring.</p>

<p>Only trees that kept leaf or needle through the winter had any
green about them. Snarls of last year&rsquo;s bramble spread brown webs
over stone outcrops under the trees. Nettles numbered most among
the few weeds; the rest were the sorts with sharp burrs or thorns,
or stinkweed, which left a rank smell on the unwary boot that
crushed it. Scattered white patches of snow still dotted the ground
where tight clumps of trees kept deep shade. Where sunlight did
reach, it held neither strength nor warmth. The pale sun sat above
the trees to the east, but its light was crisply dark, as if mixed
with shadow. It was an awkward morning, made for unpleasant
thoughts.</p>

<p>Without thinking he touched the nock of the arrow; it was ready
to draw to his cheek in one smooth movement, the way Tam had taught
him. Winter had been bad enough on the farms, worse than even the
oldest folk remembered, but it must have been harsher still in the
mountains, if the number of wolves driven down into the Two Rivers
was any guide. Wolves raided the sheep pens and chewed their way
into barns to get the cattle and horses. Bears had been after the
sheep, too, where a bear had not been seen in years. It was no
longer safe to be out after dark. Men were the prey as often as
sheep, and the sun did not always have to be down.</p>

<p>Tam was taking steady strides on the other side of Bela, using
his spear as a walking staff, ignoring the wind that made his brown
cloak flap like a banner. Now and again he touched the mare&rsquo;s flank
lightly, to remind her to keep moving. With his thick chest and
broad face, he was a pillar of reality in that morning, like a
stone in the middle of a drifting dream. His sun-roughened cheeks
might be lined and his hair have only a sprinkling of black among
the gray, but there was a solidness to him, as though a flood could
wash around him without uprooting his feet. He stumped down the
road now impassively. Wolves and bears were all very well, his
manner said, things that any man who kept sheep must be aware of,
but they had best not try to stop Tam al&rsquo;Thor getting to Emond&rsquo;s
Field.</p>

<p>With a guilty start Rand returned to watching his side of the
road, Tam&rsquo;s matter-of-factness reminding him of his task. He was a
head taller than his father, taller than anyone else in the
district, and had little of Tam in him physically, except perhaps
for a breadth of shoulder. Gray eyes and the reddish tinge to his
hair came from his mother, so Tam said. She had been an outlander,
and Rand remembered little of her aside from a smiling face, though
he did put flowers on her grave every year, at Bel Tine, in the
spring, and at Sunday, in the summer.</p>

<p>Two small casks of Tam&rsquo;s apple brandy rested in the lurching
cart, and eight larger barrels of apple cider, only slightly hard
after a winter&rsquo;s curing. Tam delivered the same every year to the
Winespring Inn for use during Bel Tine, and he had declared that it
would take more than wolves or a cold wind to stop him this spring.
Even so they had not been to the village for weeks. Not even Tam
traveled much these days. But Tam had given his word about the
brandy and cider, even if he had waited to make delivery until the
day before Festival. Keeping his word was important to Tam. Rand
was just glad to get away from the farm, almost as glad as about
the coming of Bel Tine.</p>

<p>As Rand watched his side of the road, the feeling grew in him
that he was being watched. For a while he tried to shrug it off.
Nothing moved or made a sound among the trees, except the wind. But
the feeling not only persisted, it grew stronger. The hairs on his
arms stirred; his skin prickled as if it itched on the inside.</p>

<p>He shifted his bow irritably to rub at his arms, and told
himself to stop letting fancies take him. There was nothing in the
woods on his side of the road, and Tam would have spoken if there
had been anything on the other. He glanced over his shoulder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and blinked. Not more than twenty spans back down the road a
cloaked figure on horseback followed them, horse and rider alike
black, dull and ungleaming.</p>

<p>It was more habit than anything else that kept him walking
backward alongside the cart even while he looked.</p>

<p>The rider&rsquo;s cloak covered him to his boot tops, the cowl tugged
well forward so no part of him showed. Vaguely Rand thought there
was something odd about the horseman, but it was the shadowed
opening of the hood that fascinated him. He could see only the
vaguest outlines of a face, but he had the feeling he was looking
right into the rider&rsquo;s eyes. And he could not look away. Queasiness
settled in his stomach. There was only shadow to see in the hood,
but he felt hatred as sharply as if he could see a snarling face,
hatred for everything that lived. Hatred for him most of all, for
him above all things.</p>

<p>Abruptly a stone caught his heel and he stumbled, breaking his
eyes away from the dark horseman. His bow dropped to the road, and
only an outthrust hand grabbing Bela&rsquo;s harness saved him from
falling flat on his back. With a startled snort the mare stopped,
twisting her head to see what had caught her.</p>

<p>Tam frowned over Bela&rsquo;s back at him. &ldquo;Are you all right,
lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rider,&rdquo; Rand said breathlessly, pulling himself upright. &ldquo;A
stranger, following us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; The older man lifted his broad-bladed spear and peered
back warily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, down the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s words trailed off as he turned to
point. The road behind was empty. Disbelieving, he stared into the
forest on both sides of the road. Bare-branched trees offered no
hiding place, but there was not a glimmer of horse or horseman. He
met his father&rsquo;s questioning gaze. &ldquo;He was there. A man in a black
cloak, on a black horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt your word, lad, but where has he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he was there.&rdquo; He snatched up the fallen bow
and arrow, hastily checked the fletching before renocking, and half
drew before letting the bowstring relax. There was nothing to aim
at. &ldquo;He was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam shook his grizzled head. &ldquo;If you say so, lad. Come on, then.
A horse leaves hoof prints, even on this ground.&rdquo; He started toward
the rear of the cart, his cloak whipping in the wind. &ldquo;If we find
them, we&rsquo;ll know for a fact he was there. If not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, these
are days to make a man think he&rsquo;s seeing things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly Rand realized what had been odd about the horseman,
aside from his being there at all. The wind that beat at Tam and
him had not so much as shifted a fold of that black cloak. His
mouth was suddenly dry. He must have imagined it. His father was
right; this was a morning to prickle a man&rsquo;s imagination. But he
did not believe it. Only, how did he tell his father that the man
who had apparently vanished into thin air wore a cloak the wind did
not touch?</p>

<p>With a worried frown he peered into the woods around them; it
looked different than it ever had before. Almost since he was old
enough to walk, he had run loose in the forest. The ponds and
streams of the Waterwood, beyond the last farms east of Emond&rsquo;s
Field, were where he had learned to swim. He had explored into the
Sand Hills&mdash;which many in the Two Rivers said was bad
luck&mdash;and once he had even gone to the very foot of the
Mountains of Mist, him and his closest friends, Mat Cauthon and
Perrin Aybara. That was a lot further afield than most people in
Emond&rsquo;s Field ever went; to them a journey to the next village, up
to Watch Hill or down to Deven Ride, was a big event. Nowhere in
all of that had he found a place that made him afraid. Today,
though, the Westwood was not the place he remembered. A man who
could disappear so suddenly could reappear just as suddenly, maybe
even right beside them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, father, there&rsquo;s no need.&rdquo; When Tam stopped in surprise,
Rand covered his flush by tugging at the hood of his cloak. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
probably right. No point looking for what isn&rsquo;t there, not when we
can use the time getting on to the village and out of this
wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could do with a pipe,&rdquo; Tam said slowly, &ldquo;and a mug of ale
where it&rsquo;s warm.&rdquo; Abruptly he gave a broad grin. &ldquo;And I expect
you&rsquo;re eager to see Egwene.</p>

<p>Rand managed a weak smile. Of all things he might want to think
about right then, the Mayor&rsquo;s daughter was far down the list. He
did not need any more confusion. For the past year she had been
making him increasingly jittery whenever they were together. Worse,
she did not even seem to be aware of it. No, he certainly did not
want to add Egwene to his thoughts.</p>

<p>He was hoping his father had not noticed he was afraid when Tam
said, &ldquo;Remember the flame, lad, and the void.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an odd thing Tam had taught him. Concentrate on a single
flame and feed all your passions into it&mdash;fear, hate, anger&mdash;until your mind became empty. Become one with the void, Tam
said, and you could do anything. Nobody else in Emond&rsquo;s Field
talked that way. But Tam won the archery competition at Bel Tine
every year with his flame and his void. Rand thought he might have
a chance at placing this year himself, if he could manage to hold
onto the void. For Tam to bring it up now meant he <em>had</em> noticed, but
he said nothing more about it.</p>

<p>Tam clucked Bela into motion once more, and they resumed their
journey, the older man striding along as if nothing untoward had
happened and nothing untoward could. Rand wished he could imitate
him. He tried forming the emptiness in his mind, but it kept
slipping away into images of the black-cloaked horseman.</p>

<p>He wanted to believe that Tam was right, that the rider had just
been his imagination, but he could remember that feeling of hatred
too well. There <em>had</em> been someone. And that someone had meant him
harm. He did not stop looking back until the high-peaked, thatched
roofs of Emond&rsquo;s Field surrounded him.</p>

<p>The village lay close onto the Westwood, the forest gradually
thinning until the last few trees stood actually among the stout
frame houses. The land sloped gently down to the east. Though not
without patches of woods, farms and hedge-bordered fields and
pastures quilted the land beyond the village all the way to the
Waterwood and its tangle of streams and ponds. The land to the west
was just as fertile, and the pastures there lush in most years, but
only a handful of farms could be found in the Westwood. Even those
few dwindled to none miles short of the Sand Hills, not to mention
the Mountains of Mist, which rose above the Westwood treetops,
distant but in plain sight from Emond&rsquo;s Field. Some said the land
was too rocky, as if there were not rocks everywhere in the Two
Rivers, and others said it was hard-luck land. A few muttered that
there was no point getting any closer to the mountains than needs
be. Whatever the reasons, only the hardiest men farmed in the
Westwood.</p>

<p>Small children and dogs dodged around the cart in whooping
swarms once it passed the first row of houses. Bela plodded on
patiently, ignoring the yelling youngsters who tumbled under her
nose, playing tag and rolling hoops. In the last months there had
been little of play or laughter from the children; even when the
weather had slackened enough to let children out, fear of wolves
kept them in. It seemed the approach of Bel Tine had taught them
how to play again.</p>

<p>Festival had affected the adults as well. Broad shutters were
thrown back, and in almost every house the goodwife stood in a
window, apron tied about her and long-braided hair done up in a
kerchief, shaking sheets or hanging mattresses over the
windowsills. Whether or not leaves had appeared on the trees, no
woman would let Bel Tine come before her spring cleaning was done.
In every yard rugs hung from stretched lines, and children who had
not been quick enough to run free in the streets instead vented
their frustration on the carpets with wicker beaters. On roof after
roof the goodman of the house clambered about, checking the thatch
to see if the winter&rsquo;s damage meant calling on old Cenn Buie, the
thatcher.</p>

<p>Several times Tam paused to engage one man or another in brief
conversation. Since he and Rand had not been off the farm for
weeks, everyone wanted to catch up on how things were out that way.
Few Westwood men had been in. Tam spoke of damage from winter
storms, each one worse than the one before, and stillborn lambs, of
brown fields where crops should be sprouting and pastures greening,
of ravens flocking in where songbirds had come in years before.
Grim talk, with preparations for Bel Tine going on all around them,
and much shaking of heads. It was the same on all sides.</p>

<p>Most of the men rolled their shoulders and said, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll
survive, the Light willing.&rdquo; Some grinned and added, &ldquo;And if the
Light doesn&rsquo;t will, we&rsquo;ll still survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the way of most Two Rivers people. People who had to
watch the hail beat their crops or the wolves take their lambs, and
start over, no matter how many years it happened, did not give up
easily. Most of those who did were long since gone.</p>

<p>Tam would not have stopped for Wit Congar if the man had not
come out into the street so they had to halt or let Bela run over
him. The Congars&mdash;and the Coplins; the two families were so
intermarried no one really knew where one family let off and the
other began&mdash;were known from Watch Hill to Deven Ride, and
maybe as far as Taren Ferry, as complainers and troublemakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to get this to Bran al&rsquo;Vere, Wit,&rdquo; Tam said, nodding to
the barrels in the cart, but the scrawny man held his ground with a
sour expression on his face. He had been sprawled on his front
steps, not up on his roof, though the thatch looked as if it badly
needed Master Buie&rsquo;s attention. He never seemed ready to start
over, or to finish what he started the first time. Most of the
Coplins and Congars were like that, those who were not worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do about Nynaeve, al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; Congar
demanded. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have a Wisdom like that for Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam sighed heavily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not our place, Wit. The Wisdom is
women&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better do something, al&rsquo;Thor. She said we&rsquo;d have a
mild winter. And a good harvest. Now you ask her what she hears on
the wind, and she just scowls at you and stomps off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you asked her the way you usually do, Wit,&rdquo; Tam said
patiently, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re lucky she didn&rsquo;t thump you with that stick she
carries. Now if you don&rsquo;t mind, this brandy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara is just too young to be Wisdom, al&rsquo;Thor. If
the Women&rsquo;s Circle won&rsquo;t do something, then the Village Council has
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business of yours is the Wisdom, Wit Congar?&rdquo; roared a
woman&rsquo;s voice. Wit flinched as his wife marched out of the house.
Daise Congar was twice as wide as Wit, a hard-faced woman without
an ounce of fat on her. She glared at him with her fists on her
hips. &ldquo;You try meddling in Women&rsquo;s Circle business, and see how you
like eating your own cooking. Which you won&rsquo;t do in my kitchen. And
washing your own clothes and making your own bed. Which won&rsquo;t be
under my roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Daise,&rdquo; Wit whined, &ldquo;I was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll pardon me, Daise,&rdquo; Tam said. &ldquo;Wit. The Light shine on
you both.&rdquo; He got Bela moving again, leading her around the scrawny
fellow. Daise was concentrating on her husband now, but any minute
she could realize whom it was Wit had been talking to.</p>

<p>That was why they had not accepted any of the invitations to
stop for a bite to eat or something hot to drink. When they saw
Tam, the goodwives of Emond&rsquo;s Field went on point like hounds
spotting a rabbit. There was not a one of them who did not know
just the perfect wife for a widower with a good farm, even if it
was in the Westwood.</p>

<p>Rand stepped along just as quickly as Tam, perhaps even more so.
He was sometimes cornered when Tam was not around, with no way to
escape outside of rudeness. Herded onto a stool by the kitchen
fire, he would be fed pastries or honeycakes or meatpies. And
always the goodwife&rsquo;s eyes weighed and measured him as neatly as
any merchant&rsquo;s scales and tapes while she told him that what he was
eating was not nearly so good as her widowed sister&rsquo;s cooking, or
her next-to-eldest cousin&rsquo;s. Tam was certainly not getting any
younger, she would say. It was good that he had loved his wife so&mdash;it boded well for the next woman in his life&mdash;but he
had mourned long enough. Tam needed a good woman. It was a simple
fact, she would say, or something very close, that a man just could
not do without a woman to take care of him and keep him out of
trouble. Worst of all were those who paused thoughtfully at about
that point, then asked with elaborate casualness exactly how old <em>he</em>
was now.</p>

<p>Like most Two Rivers folk, Rand had a strong stubborn streak.
Outsiders sometimes said it was the prime trait of people in the
Two Rivers, that they could give mules lessons and teach stones.
The goodwives were fine and kindly women for the most part, but he
hated being pushed into anything, and they made him feel as if he
were being prodded with sticks. So he walked fast, and wished Tam
would hurry Bela along.</p>

<p>Soon the street opened onto the Green, a broad expanse in the
middle of the village. Usually covered with thick grass, the Green
this spring showed only a few fresh patches among the yellowish
brown of dead grass and the black of bare earth. A double handful
of geese waddled about, beadily eyeing the ground but not finding
anything worth pecking, and someone had tethered a milkcow to crop
the sparse growth.</p>

<p>Toward the west end of the Green, the Winespring itself gushed
out of a low stone outcrop in a flow that never failed, a flow
strong enough to knock a man down and sweet enough to justify its
name a dozen times over. From the spring the rapidly widening
Winespring Water ran swiftly off to the east, willows dotting its
banks all the way to Master Thane&rsquo;s mill and beyond, until it split
into dozens of streams in the swampy depths of the Waterwood. Two
low, railed footbridges crossed the clear stream at the Green, and
one bridge, wider than the others and stout enough to bear wagons.
The Wagon Bridge marked where the North Road, coming down from
Taren Ferry and Watch Hill, became the Old Road, leading to Deven
Ride. Outsiders sometimes found it funny that the road had one name
to the north and another to the south, but that was the way it had
always been, as far as anyone in Emond&rsquo;s Field knew, and that was
that. It was a good enough reason for Two Rivers people.</p>

<p>On the far side of the bridges, the mounds were already building
for the Bel Tine fires, three careful stacks of logs almost as big
as houses. They had to be on cleared dirt, of course, not on the
Green, even sparse as it was. What of Festival did not take place
around the fires would happen on the Green.</p>

<p>Near the Winespring a score of older women sang softly as they
erected the Spring Pole. Shorn of its branches, the straight,
slender trunk of a fir tree stood ten feet high even in the hole
they had dug for it. A knot of girls too young to wear their hair
braided sat cross-legged and watched enviously, occasionally
singing snatches of the song the women sang.</p>

<p>Tam clucked at Bela as if to make her speed her pace, though she
ignored it, and Rand studiously kept his eyes from what the women
were doing. In the morning the men would pretend to be surprised to
find the Pole, then at noon the unmarried women would dance the
Pole, entwining it with long, colored ribbons while the unmarried
men sang. No one knew when the custom began or why&mdash;it was
another thing that was the way it had always been&mdash;but it was
an excuse to sing and dance, and nobody in the Two Rivers needed
much excuse for that.</p>

<p>The whole day of Bel Tine would be taken up with singing and
dancing and feasting, with time out for footraces, and contests in
almost everything. Prizes would be given not only in archery, but
for the best with the sling, and the quarterstaff. There would be
contests at solving riddles and puzzles, at the rope tug, and
lifting and tossing weights, prizes for the best singer, the best
dancer and the best fiddle player, for the quickest to shear a
sheep, even the best at bowls, and at darts.</p>

<p>Bel Tine was supposed to come when spring had well and truly
arrived, the first lambs born and the first crop up. Even with the
cold hanging on, though, no one had any idea of putting it off.
Everyone could use a little singing and dancing. And to top
everything, if the rumors could be believed, a grand display of
fireworks was planned for the Green&mdash;if the first peddler of
the year appeared in time, of course. That had been causing
considerable talk; it was ten years since the last such display,
and that was still talked about.</p>

<p>The Winespring Inn stood at the east end of the Green, hard
beside the Wagon Bridge. The first floor of the inn was river rock,
though the foundation was of older stone some said came from the
mountains. The white-washed second story&mdash;where Brandelwyn
al&rsquo;Vere, the innkeeper and Mayor of Emond&rsquo;s Field for the past
twenty years, lived in the back with his wife and daughters&mdash;jutted
out over the lower floor all the way around. Red roof tile, the
only such roof in the village, glittered in the weak sunlight, and
smoke drifted from three of the inn&rsquo;s dozen tall chimneys.</p>

<p>At the south end of the inn, away from the stream, stretched the
remains of a much larger stone foundation, once part of the inn&mdash;or so it was said. A huge oak grew in the middle of it now,
with a bole thirty paces around and spreading branches as thick as
a man. In the summer, Bran al&rsquo;Vere set tables and benches under
those branches, shady with leaves then, where people could enjoy a
cup and a cooling breeze while they talked or perhaps set out a
board for a game of stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, lad.&rdquo; Tam reached for Bela&rsquo;s harness, but she
stopped in front of the inn before his hand touched leather. &ldquo;Knows
the way better than I do,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>

<p>As the last creak of the axle faded, Bran al&rsquo;Vere appeared from
the inn, seeming as always to step too lightly for a man of his
girth, nearly double that of anyone else in the village. A smile
split his round face, which was topped by a sparse fringe of gray
hair. The innkeeper was in his shirtsleeves despite the chill, with
a spotless white apron wrapped around him. A silver medallion in
the form of a set of balance scales hung on his chest.</p>

<p>The medallion, along with the full-size set of scales used to
weigh the coins of the merchants who came down from Baerlon for
wool or tabac, was the symbol of the Mayor&rsquo;s office. Bran only wore
it for dealing with the merchants and for festivals, feastdays, and
weddings. He had it on a day early now, but that night was
Winternight, the night before Bel Tine, when everyone would visit
back and forth almost the whole night long, exchanging small gifts,
having a bite to eat and a touch to drink at every house. <em>After the
winter</em>, Rand thought, <em>he probably considers Winternight excuse
enough not to wait until tomorrow</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tam,&rdquo; the Mayor shouted as he hurried toward them. &ldquo;The Light
shine on me, it&rsquo;s good to see you at last. And you, Rand. How are
you, my boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, Master al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;And you, sir?&rdquo; But Bran&rsquo;s
attention was already back on Tam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was almost beginning to think you wouldn&rsquo;t be bringing your
brandy this year. You&rsquo;ve never waited so late before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no liking for leaving the farm these days, Bran,&rdquo; Tam
replied. &ldquo;Not with the wolves the way they are. And the
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran harrumphed. &ldquo;I could wish somebody wanted to talk about
something besides the weather. Everyone complains about it, and
folk who should know better expect me to set it right. I&rsquo;ve just
spent twenty minutes explaining to Mistress al&rsquo;Donel that I can do
nothing about the storks. Though what she expected me to do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
He shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ill omen,&rdquo; a scratchy voice announced, &ldquo;no storks nesting on
the rooftops at Bel Tine.&rdquo; Cenn Buie, as gnarled and dark as an old
root, marched up to Tam and Bran and leaned on his walking staff,
near as tall as he was and just as gnarled. He tried to fix both
men at once with a beady eye. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s worse to come, you mark my
words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you become a soothsayer, then, interpreting omens?&rdquo; Tam
asked dryly. &ldquo;Or do you listen to the wind, like a Wisdom? There&rsquo;s
certainly enough of it. Some originating not far from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mock if you will,&rdquo; Cenn muttered, &ldquo;but if it doesn&rsquo;t warm
enough for crops to sprout soon, more than one root cellar will
come up empty before there&rsquo;s a harvest. By next winter there may be
nothing left alive in the Two Rivers but wolves and ravens. If it
is next winter at all. Maybe it will still be this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what is that supposed to mean?&rdquo; Bran said sharply.</p>

<p>Cenn
gave them a sour look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not much good to say about Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara. You know that. For one thing, she&rsquo;s too young to&mdash;No matter. The Women&rsquo;s Circle seems to object to the Village
Council even talking about their business, though they interfere in
ours whenever they want to, which is most of the time, or so it
seems to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cenn,&rdquo; Tam broke in, &ldquo;is there a point to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the point, al&rsquo;Thor. Ask the Wisdom when the winter will
end, and she walks away. Maybe she doesn&rsquo;t want to tell us what she
hears on the wind. Maybe what she hears is that the winter won&rsquo;t
end. Maybe it&rsquo;s just going to go on being winter until the Wheel
turns and the Age ends. There&rsquo;s your point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe sheep will fly,&rdquo; Tam retorted, and Bran threw up his
hands. &ldquo;The Light protect me from fools. You sitting on the Village
Council, Cenn, and now you&rsquo;re spreading that Coplin talk. Well, you
listen to me. We have enough problems without&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick tug at Rand&rsquo;s sleeve and a voice pitched low, for his
ear alone, distracted him from the older men&rsquo;s talk. &ldquo;Come on,
Rand, while they&rsquo;re arguing. Before they put you to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced down, and had to grin. Mat Cauthon crouched beside
the cart so Tam and Bran and Cenn could not see him, his wiry body
contorted like a stork trying to bend itself double.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s brown eyes twinkled with mischief, as usual. &ldquo;Dav and I
caught a big old badger, all grouchy at being pulled out of his
den. We&rsquo;re going to let it loose on the Green and watch the girls
run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s smile broadened; it did not sound as much like fun to him
as it would have a year or two back, but Mat never seemed to grow
up. He took a quick look at his father&mdash;the men had their
heads together still, all three talking at once&mdash;then lowered
his own voice. &ldquo;I promised to unload the cider. I can meet you
later, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat rolled his eyes skyward. &ldquo;Toting barrels! Burn me, I&rsquo;d
rather play stones with my baby sister. Well, I know of better
things than a badger. We have strangers in the Two Rivers. Last
evening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Rand stopped breathing. &ldquo;A man on horseback?&rdquo; he
asked intently. &ldquo;A man in a black cloak, on a black horse? And his
cloak doesn&rsquo;t move in the wind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat swallowed his grin, and his voice dropped to an even hoarser
whisper. &ldquo;You saw him, too? I thought I was the only one. Don&rsquo;t
laugh, Rand, but he scared me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing. He scared me, too. I could swear he hated me,
that he wanted to kill me.&rdquo; Rand shivered. Until that day he had
never thought of anyone wanting to kill him, really wanting to kill
him. That sort of thing just did not happen in the Two Rivers. A
fistfight, maybe, or a wrestling match, but not killing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about hating, Rand, but he was scary enough
anyway. All he did was sit on his horse looking at me, just outside
the village, but I&rsquo;ve never been so frightened in my life. Well, I
looked away, just for a moment&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t easy, mind you&mdash;then when I looked back he&rsquo;d vanished. Blood and ashes!
Three days, it&rsquo;s been, and I can hardly stop thinking about him. I
keep looking over my shoulder.&rdquo; Mat attempted a laugh that came out
as a croak. &ldquo;Funny how being scared takes you. You think strange
things. I actually thought&mdash;just for a minute, mind&mdash;it
might be the Dark One. &ldquo; He tried another laugh, but no sound at
all came out this time.</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. As much to remind himself as for any
other reason, he said by rote, &ldquo;The Dark One and all of the
Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul, beyond the Great Blight, bound
by the Creator at the moment of Creation, bound until the end of
time. The hand of the Creator shelters the world, and the Light
shines on us all.&rdquo; He drew another breath and went on. &ldquo;Besides, if
he was free, what would the Shepherd of the Night be doing in the
Two Rivers watching farm boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that rider was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;evil. Don&rsquo;t
laugh. I&rsquo;ll take oath on it. Maybe it was the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just full of cheerful thoughts, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Rand
muttered. &ldquo;You sound worse than Cenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother always said the Forsaken would come for me if I
didn&rsquo;t mend my ways. If I ever saw anybody who looked like
Ishamael, or Aginor, it was him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s mother scared them with the Forsaken,&rdquo; Rand said
dryly, &ldquo;but most grow out of it. Why not the Shadowman, while
you&rsquo;re about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat glared at him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been so scared since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No,
I&rsquo;ve never been that scared, and I don&rsquo;t mind admitting it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, either. My father thinks I was jumping at shadows under the
trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded glumly and leaned back against the cart wheel. &ldquo;So
does my da. I told Dav, and Elam Dowtry. They&rsquo;ve been watching like
hawks ever since, but they haven&rsquo;t seen anything. Now Elam thinks I
was trying to trick him. Dav thinks he&rsquo;s down from Taren Ferry&mdash;a sheepstealer, or a chickenthief. A chickenthief!&rdquo; He
lapsed into affronted silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably all foolishness anyway,&rdquo; Rand said finally.
&ldquo;Maybe he is just a sheepstealer.&rdquo; He tried to picture it, but it
was like picturing a wolf taking the cat&rsquo;s place in front of a
mouse hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t like the way he looked at me. And neither did
you, not if how you jumped at me is any guide. We ought to tell
someone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We already have, Mat, both of us, and we weren&rsquo;t believed. Can
you imagine trying to convince Master al&rsquo;Vere about this fellow,
without him seeing him? He&rsquo;d send us off to Nynaeve to see if we
were sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two of us, now. Nobody could believe we both imagined
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand rubbed the top of his head briskly, wondering what to say.
Mat was something of a byword around the village. Few people had
escaped his pranks. Now his name came up whenever a washline
dropped the laundry in the dirt or a loose saddle girth deposited a
farmer in the road. Mat did not even have to be anywhere around.
His support might be worse than none.</p>

<p>After a moment Rand said, &ldquo;Your father would believe you put me
up to it, and mine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He looked over the cart to where Tam and
Bran and Cenn had been talking, and found himself staring his
father in the eyes. The Mayor was still lecturing Cenn, who took it now in sullen
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Matrim,&rdquo; Tam said brightly, hefting one of the
brandy casks up onto the side of the cart. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve come to
help Rand unload the cider. Good lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat leaped to his feet at the first word and began backing away.
&ldquo;Good morning to you, Master al&rsquo;Thor. And to you, Master al&rsquo;Vere.
Master Buie. May the Light shine on you. My da sent me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt he did,&rdquo; Tam said. &ldquo;And no doubt, since you are a lad
who does his chores right off, you&rsquo;ve finished the task already.
Well, the quicker you lads get the cider into Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s
cellar, the quicker you can see the gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gleeman!&rdquo; Mat exclaimed, stopping dead in his footsteps, at the
same instant that Rand asked, &ldquo;When will he get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could remember only two gleemen coming into the Two Rivers
in his whole life, and for one of those he had been young enough to
sit on Tam&rsquo;s shoulders to watch. To have one there actually during
Bel Tine, with his harp and his flute and his stories and all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Emond&rsquo;s Field would still be talking about this Festival ten years
off, even if there were not any fireworks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolishness,&rdquo; Cenn grumbled, but fell silent at a look from
Bran that had all the weight of the Mayor&rsquo;s office in it.</p>

<p>Tam leaned against the side of the cart, using the brandy cask
as a prop for his arm. &ldquo;Yes, a gleeman, and already here. According to Master al&rsquo;Vere,
he&rsquo;s in a room in the inn right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived in the dead of night, he did.&rdquo; The innkeeper shook his
head in disapproval. &ldquo;Pounded on the front door till he woke the
whole family. If not for Festival, I&rsquo;d have told him to stable his
own horse and sleep in the stall with it, gleeman or not. Imagine
coming in the dark like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared wonderingly. No one traveled beyond the village by
night, not these days, certainly not alone. The thatcher grumbled
under his breath again, too low this time for Rand to understand
more than a word or two. &ldquo;Madman&rdquo; and &ldquo;unnatural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t wear a black cloak, does he?&rdquo; Mat asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Bran&rsquo;s belly shook with his chuckle. &ldquo;Black! His cloak is like
every gleeman&rsquo;s cloak I&rsquo;ve ever seen. More patches than cloak, and
more colors than you can think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand startled himself by laughing out loud, a laugh of pure
relief. The menacing black-clad rider as a gleeman was a ridiculous
notion, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He clapped a hand over his mouth in embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,
Tam,&rdquo; Bran said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been little enough laughter in this
village since winter came. Now even the gleeman&rsquo;s cloak brings a
laugh. That alone is worth the expense of bringing him down from
Baerlon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say what you will,&rdquo; Cenn spoke up suddenly. &ldquo;I still say it&rsquo;s a
foolish waste of money. And those fireworks you all insisted on
sending off for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there <em>are</em> fireworks,&rdquo; Mat said, but Cenn went right on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They should have been here a month ago with the first peddler of
the year, but there hasn&rsquo;t been a peddler, has there? If he doesn&rsquo;t
come by tomorrow, what are we going to do with them? Hold another
Festival just to set them off? That&rsquo;s if he even brings them, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cenn&rdquo;&mdash;Tam sighed&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve as much trust as a Taren Ferry
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then? Tell me that, al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo; Mat demanded in an aggrieved voice.
&ldquo;The whole village would have had as much fun with the waiting as
with the gleeman. Or almost, anyway. You can see how everybody&rsquo;s
been over just a rumor of fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; Bran replied with a sidelong look at the thatcher.
&ldquo;And if I knew for sure how that rumor started&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if I thought,
for instance, that somebody had been complaining about how much
things cost where people could hear him when the things are
supposed to be secret&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn cleared his throat. &ldquo;My bones are too old for this wind. If
you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll just see if Mistress al&rsquo;Vere won&rsquo;t fix me some
mulled wine to take the chill off. Mayor. Al&rsquo;Thor. &ldquo; He was headed
for the inn before he finished, and as the door swung shut behind
him, Bran sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think Nynaeve is right about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, that&rsquo;s not
important now. You young fellows think for a minute. Everyone&rsquo;s
excited about the fireworks, true, and that&rsquo;s only at a rumor.
Think how they&rsquo;ll be if the peddler doesn&rsquo;t get here in time, after
all their anticipating. And with the weather the way it is, who
knows when he will come. They&rsquo;d be fifty times as excited about a
gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And feel fifty times as bad if he hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; Rand said
slowly. &ldquo;Even Bel Tine might not do much for people&rsquo;s spirits after
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a head on your shoulders when you choose to use it,&rdquo;
Bran said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll follow you on the Village Council one day, Tam.
Mark my words. He couldn&rsquo;t do much worse right now than someone I
could name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of this is unloading the cart,&rdquo; Tam said briskly, handing
the first cask of brandy to the Mayor. &ldquo;I want a warm fire, my
pipe, and a mug of your good ale.&rdquo; He hoisted the second brandy
cask onto his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Rand will thank you for your
help, Matrim. Remember, the sooner the cider is in the cellar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Tam and Bran disappeared into the inn, Rand looked at his
friend. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to help. Dav won&rsquo;t keep that badger long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why not?&rdquo; Mat said resignedly. &ldquo;Like your da said, the
quicker it&rsquo;s in the cellar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Picking up one of the casks of
cider in both arms, he hurried toward the inn in a half trot.
&ldquo;Maybe Egwene is around. Watching you stare at her like a poleaxed
ox will be as good as a badger any day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand paused in the act of putting his bow and quiver in the back
of the cart. He really had managed to put Egwene out of his mind.
That was unusual in itself. But she would likely be around the inn
somewhere. There was not much chance he could avoid her. Of course,
it had been weeks since he saw her last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mat called from the front of the inn. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I
would do it by myself. You aren&rsquo;t on the Village Council yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a start, Rand took up a cask and followed. Perhaps she
would not be there after all. Oddly, that possibility did not make
him feel any better.</p>
